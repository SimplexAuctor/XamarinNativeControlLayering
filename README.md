# XamarinNativeControlLayering
This repository demonstrates some methods of native control reordering that do not work.  Some methods (layout.LowerChild) work on Xamarin Forms controls, but do not work on native controls.

Renderers and Native Control Hosting have been testing (and are demonstrated) with the same results.
